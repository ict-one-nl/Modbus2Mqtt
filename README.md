# Modbus2Mqtt

This is a very very early version of a modbus2mqtt bridge. Currently it lacks support for a *lot* of functions, but the basic infrastructure is there. To use it, view the configuration.yml example. To add devices have a look at the DeviceTemplates directory (EastronSDM120.yml) as an example.
